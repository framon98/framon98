# 👋 Hi, I’m @framon98 or Francisco

I am a Mechatronics Engineer with a passion for Software Development and DevOps.

I currently work @Intel as a DevOps Engineer in a team that manages compute resources for the development and validation teams for new products. 

I’m interested in new technologies and open-source as well as in automation and large-scale deployments and systems. 

My day to day outside of work is more focused on learning and enhancing my skills in Data Structures and Algorithms as well as reading fantasy or science fictions books.
